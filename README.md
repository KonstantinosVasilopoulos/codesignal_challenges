# CodeSignal Challenges

[CodeSignal](https://codesignal.com/) is popular website hosting coding challenges aimed at helping people familiarize themselves with coding-interviews. Many challenges are from Google, Amazon or other FAANG companies. Here is a list containing some of the many challenges I have solved. As of now, it only holds solutions written in Rust, but in my [CodeSignal account](https://app.codesignal.com/profile/costas_v) you can find solutions written in other programming languages too.
